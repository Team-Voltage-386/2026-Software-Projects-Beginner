This repo contains multiple folders. Each folder is an individual project designed to teach various skills.
Projects are being ported over from the 2025-Software-Projects-Beginner as they as converted to the 2026 development environment.
In order to run the code within a project, it's necessary to open the specific project folder in VSCode rather than the entire collection.  
Ie. if you want to run the LEDDemoboardExample, open that folder in VSCode.

Many of these projects have history however that history is still within the 2025 version of this repo. If you want to see more variations, check the branches and history in that repo.
# Projects Overview 
* `Basic_Motor_Control`
    * This is really a demo for students to get a feel for how a motor reacts to changes in voltage
    * Goal is for users can get an intuitive feel of how changes in voltage affect the speed of a motor.
    * The Elastic dashboard includes display of what the motor is currently doing as well as allowing the user to change the voltage.

* `LEDDemoboardExample`
    *  An example project about how to use LEDs on the demo-board. * This is where the updated code is!
* `Simulation-Robot`
    *  An example project with a simulated swerve drive.  It illustrates how to use PathPlanner, AdvantageScope as well as the simulator. Details on how to get it running can be found in Programming Like a Varmint in the Software folder on the team Drive

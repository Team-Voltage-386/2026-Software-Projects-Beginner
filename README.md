This repo contains multiple folders. Each folder is an individual project designed to teach various skills.
Projects are being ported over from the 2025-Software-Projects-Beginner as they as converted to the 2026 development environment.
In order to run the code within a project, it's necessary to open the specific project folder in VSCode rather than the entire collection.  
Ie. if you want to run the LEDDemoboardExample, open that folder in VSCode.

Many of these projects have history however that history is still within the 2025 version of this repo. If you want to see more variations, check the branches and history in that repo.
